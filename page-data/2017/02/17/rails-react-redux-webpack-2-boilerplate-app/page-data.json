It can bundle all JS files for usage in the browser, but can also transform / bundle / package any resource or frontend asset.</p>\n<p>JavaScript community moves forward at a rapid pace, new frameworks and modules are being released every day. The <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NPM</a> ecosystem is huge, and Webpack makes it available in the simplest way possible.</p>\n<p>Webpack can support every modern JS app, using ES6 or CommonJS modules, or both, create a single or multiple bundles, and in general can be customized to accomplish any application requirement.</p>\n<p>The frontend assets on this app are placed on a more accessible directory, at <code>/front/js</code> and <code>front/css</code>, rather than <code>app/assets/javascripts</code> and <code>app/assets/stylesheets</code>.</p>\n<p>At any point, migration to a different backend (for example NodeJS) can be seamless since Webpack is running as a stand-alone bundler. There's absolutely no dependence to the Asset Pipeline or any other framework-specific module.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, Webpack 2 boilerplate app","date":"17 Feb 2017"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2875828811"],"slicesMap":{}}
